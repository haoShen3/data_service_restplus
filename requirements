I'm a student at University of New South Walse. I'm tring to build an API by rest-plus. This document is used to record my learning
    experiences. 
This is the Specification:
    *develop a Flask-Restplus data service that allows a client to read and store some publicly available economic indicator data for 
        countries around the world, and allow the consumers to access the data through a REST API.
    *The World Bank indicators API provides 50 year of data over more than 1500 indicators for countries around the world.
    *List of indicators can be found at: http://api.worldbank.org/v2/indicators
    *List of countries can be found at: http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries
